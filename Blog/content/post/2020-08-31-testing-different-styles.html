<main>
<h1>
Heading level 1
</h1>
<p>
This is a paragraph.
</p>
<h2>
Heading level 2
</h2>
<p>
And this is another paragraph. I wrote this is in the .Rmd file, not directly in the .html file! Writing it directly in the .Rmd file allows you to see it in the "Viewer" when you serve_site(), if you make the changes in the .html file these don't show up there. 
<h3> Heading 3</h3>
<p> Interesting, heading 3 is significantly smaller than heading 2, but heading 2 doesn't seem to be any smaller than heading 1. </p>

<p> I want to display a textbox, and 'extract' code from the .css file.</p>

<div class="shadowbox">
  <p>Interesting shadowbox, but will it work on the website?</p>
</div>
