<h1>
Heading level 1
</h1>
<p>
This is a paragraph.
</p>
<h2>
Heading level 2
</h2>
<p>
And this is another paragraph. I wrote this is in the .Rmd file, not directly in the .html file! <del>Writing it directly in the .Rmd file allows you to see it in the "Viewer" when you serve_site(), if you make the changes in the .html file these don't show up there.</del> This last section is not true, but apparently some things don't tend to show up in the "viewer" in the RStudio IDE? 
<h3> Heading 3</h3>
<p> Interesting, heading 3 is significantly smaller than heading 2, but heading 2 doesn't seem to be any smaller than heading 1. </p>

<p> I want to display a textbox, and 'extract' code from the .css file.</p>

<div class="shadowbox">
  <p>Interesting shadowbox, but will it work on the website? It does! Interesting, so by selecting the class under the div section, it seems to pull from the main.css file. Under that file are the specific for the shadowbox.</p>
</div>

<p> By writing the code for the shadowbox in the 'back-end', it makes it very easy to copy the same thing here again without having to write all the code for the shadowbox. Very useful!</p>

<div class="shadowbox">
  <p> Like so!</p>
</div>

<h4>
  <p> Heck, let's try and make the word "whales" appear in blue. We would do that like so <span class="whales">whales</span> with the span.whales code again being saved in the main.css file.</p>
</h4>
