Hello all! I figured it could be beneficial to explore various packages that are potentially useful in examining and tidying data. Given that I am still very much a novice when it comes to _R_, it would be great to understand how _R_ can assist in data wrangling. I would much appreciate feedback and suggestions of other packages that can be useful for this purpose.

# Janitor package

The first package I'd like to explore and discuss is the *janitor* package. The vignette for this package can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) but I just want to go over the main functions that this package offers, which are:

  1. format data frame column names; and
  2. identify and remove duplicate rows or columns. 
  
The package can do some other things, like create frequency tables and crosstabs, but I am not familiar with their use so I'll not discuss them. 

First things first, we need to install and load the package in _R_. We also load the _dplyr_ package because we'll be working with pipes as well.

The first function to examine is *clean_names()*. This function works great in a pipeline `%>%` and can be used when reading in the data. It handles column names that are "non-R-friendly" (i.e., have spaces or have special cases), and makes them more R-friendly. *Janitor*:

  * Returns names with only lowercase letters and separated by _. 
  * Handles special cases and spaces;
  * Converts e.g. % to percent, and # to number;
  * In the case of duplicated names, adds a number

However, it has to be said that _this package is not an all-powerful solution to difficult column names, but definitely a start_. To showcase it's use, but also it's limitations, let's create a dataframe with difficult column names:

``` {r create_df}
df_test <- as.data.frame(matrix(ncol=8))
names(df_test) <- c("firstColumn", "#_2Column", "why [ml/L]",
                    "% good columns (2009)", "d13CVPDB (‰)", "Total N (µg)",
                    "DO.[ml/L]", "DO.[ml/L]")
df_test <- df_test %>% janitor::clean_names()
```

Now notice that while these column names are more R-friendly, they're not completely similar to the input. For example, the microgram gets tidied to mg, and the L is no longer capitalized. However, I like how it handles (square) brackets and spacing, and personally I think it looks better than what base R produces:

```{r}
tidy_names <- df_test %>% clean_names()
data.frame(dirty_names = make.names(names(df_test)), tidy_names = colnames(tidy_names))
```

It will be up to user to decide whether the package is useful (and necessary) to tidy column names in the dataframe. 

## remove_empty()

Aside from the **clean_names** function, another function within this package I'd like to point out is the `remove_empty()` function. It automatically gets rid of any empty rows or columns, and can be included in the pipeline when importing the data.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
df <- read_excel("dataframe.xlsx") %>% clean_names() %>% remove_empty()
```

OR 

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
df <- janitor::remove_empty(dataframe, which = c("rows", "cols"))
# If "which" is not specified, it defaults to both rows and cols. 
```

## get_dupes()

This function within the *janitor* package can be used to examine duplicate records within a column. In a tidy dataframe you might want to have unique IDs or entries. `get_dupes()` returns the records and a count of the duplicates so you can examine them. `get_dupes()` returns a data frame with the full records where the specified variables have duplicated values, as well as a column `dupe_count` indicating the number of rows that share the duplication. A great way to examine whether you have any duplicates if you weren't expecting any!

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
df %>% get_dupes(column_name)
```
