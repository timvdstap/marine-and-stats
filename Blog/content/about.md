Hi everyone!

Welcome to my website! My name is Tim van der Stap, and I work as a Marine Data Scientist at the Hakai Institute, located on Quadra Island in beautiful British Columbia. At the Hakai Institute I am mainly involved in their Juvenile Salmon Program and as a Data Scientist for the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) Program.

A little bit about myself: I am extremely interested in the marine environment and it's wildlife, and particularly passionate about whales and dolphins and how they function within the marine environment. I have a M.Sc. degree in Biology, with a focus on Marine Biology, from the Wageningen University and Research Center (WUR) in The Netherlands. For my thesis I studied population models and the population dynamics of Risso's dolphins in the Azores, whereas during my internship I examined the marine biofouling on offshore oil- and gas platforms in the North Sea. 

I also have a strong interest in statistical analyses, and this interest was again fueled when I joined the Hakai Institute. However, when it comes to both the marine environment and statistical analyses I consider myself an eternal student, and not so much a professional scientist - I always feel like there's a lot more to learn. And sometimes I lose track of the things I have already learnt! It is for that reason that I created this website for myself; to keep track of interesting marine research and also to write out various packages or functions used in _R_, mainly for data wrangling. As said, by no means am I an expert on the matter and would therefore always appreciate feedback or comments! 
Additionally, this is the first website I've ever created, and it's very much an ever evolving project. I'm still learning lots when it comes to using the _blogdown_ package, _GitHub_ and e.g. _HTML_ and _CSS_. Hopefully though, by just recording thoughts and ideas, I'll be able to help someone! 

If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out -- this is also a good reminder for myself that I need to find a way to put my contact details up on here! So much to learn....
