Hi everyone,

My name is Tim van der Stap, and I am a marine scientist with the Hakai Institute, located on Quadra Island / Calvert Island in beautiful British Columbia! My passion lies in studying marine ecosystems, with a particular interest in the role that marine mammals play in them, and in quantitative analyses. I hold an M.Sc in Biology from the Wageningen University and Research Center in the Netherlands, with a specialization in Marine Biology. For my M.Sc thesis I studied the population dynamics of Risso's dolphins in the Azores, under Dr. Hartman of [Nova Atlantis](http://www.nova-atlantis.org/), whereas for my internship I studied the marine biofouling on offshore oil- and gas platforms in the southern North Sea. In 2015, I moved from the Netherlands to Vancouver, Canada, where - among other things - I have worked as a Naturalist for a whale watch company and was a Zodiac Skipper for their sister company, Sea Vancouver. 

I started with the Hakai Institute in April 2020, and have been involved with their Juvenile Salmon Program (JSP), where we study the factors impacting the timing of salmon outmigration to the North Pacific. Additionally, I've been involved with the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) project, where scientists study the effects of the first winter on salmon survival. I am mainly involved in that project as a Data Scientist and try to reformat data collected throughout the project to make it compatible with data repositories such as OBIS and GOOS. 

On this website / blog I want to keep track of some of the main data wrangling functions that I've applied, and perhaps in the future also share some very interesting marine research (conducted either by the Hakai Institute or just in general). Perhaps in the process it might also help other people with any stats-related issues they have, or perhaps spark some excitement for the wonder that is the marine environment!

I am very much a novice when it comes to e.g. GitHub and blogdown, and even R. As someone said, "never a professional scientist, but an eternal student". As I progress I'm hoping to 'spiffy up' this website/blog significantly!
