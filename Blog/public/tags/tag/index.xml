      <description>library(dplyr)library(janitor)Hello all! I figured it could be beneficial to explore various packages that are potentially useful in examining and tidying data. Given that I am still very much a novice when it comes to R, it would be great to understand how R can assist in data wrangling. I would much appreciate feedback and suggestions of other packages that can be useful for this purpose.
Janitor packageThe first package Iâ€™d like to explore and discuss is the janitor package.</description>
