      <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Tim van der Stap, and I work as a Marine Data Scientist at the Hakai Institute, located on Quadra Island in beautiful British Columbia. At the Hakai Institute I am mainly involved in their Juvenile Salmon Program and as a Data Scientist for the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) Program.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself: I am extremely interested in the marine environment and it&rsquo;s wildlife, and particularly passionate about whales and dolphins and how they function within the marine environment. I have a M.Sc. degree in Biology, with a focus on Marine Biology, from the Wageningen University and Research Center (WUR) in The Netherlands. For my thesis I studied population models and the population dynamics of Risso&rsquo;s dolphins in the Azores, whereas during my internship I examined the marine biofouling on offshore oil- and gas platforms in the North Sea.</p>
<p>I also have a strong interest in statistical analyses, and this interest was again fueled when I joined the Hakai Institute. However, when it comes to both the marine environment and statistical analyses I consider myself an eternal student, and not so much a professional scientist - I always feel like there&rsquo;s a lot more to learn. And sometimes I lose track of the things I have already learnt! It is for that reason that I created this website for myself; to keep track of interesting marine research and also to write out various packages or functions used in <em>R</em>, mainly for data wrangling. As said, by no means am I an expert on the matter and would therefore always appreciate feedback or comments! 
Additionally, this is the first website I&rsquo;ve ever created, and it&rsquo;s very much an ever evolving project. I&rsquo;m still learning lots when it comes to using the <em>blogdown</em> package, <em>GitHub</em> and e.g. <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. Hopefully though, by just recording thoughts and ideas, I&rsquo;ll be able to help someone!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out &ndash; this is also a good reminder for myself that I need to find a way to put my contact details up on here! So much to learn&hellip;.</p>
