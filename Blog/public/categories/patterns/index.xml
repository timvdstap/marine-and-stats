      <description>In this blog post I’d like to talk about the grep and grepl function, both found in base R (i.e. you don’t have to install a package for it) and both of which are extremely useful for pattern matching and replacement. When it comes to replacement, I will also discuss the sub() and gsub() functions. The main difference between the two grepl functions, is that the grepl() function returns a logical vector indicating which element of a character vector contains the match , whereas grep() returns the index.</description>
